      <h3>games kabaddi 1</h3>
      <h4 class="color4">kabaddi</h4>
      <p>Kabaddi is a team sport. 
        Two teams are on opposite halves of a small field.
        They take turns sending a "raider" into the other half. 
        This is to win points by tackling members of the opposing team. </p>
      <p>Then the raider tries to return to his own half.
        He holds his breath and chants the word "Kabaddi"
        during the whole raid. The raider must not cross
        the lobby unless he touches any of his opponents.
        If he does not touch anyone then he will be "out". </p>
