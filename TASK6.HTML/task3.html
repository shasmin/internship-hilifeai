            When writing the screenplay for The Curse of the Black Pearl,
            Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio envisioned Captain
            Jack Sparrow as a supporting character in the vein of Bugs Bunny
            and Groucho Marx.[1] The producers saw him as a young Burt Lancaster.

            Director Gore Verbinski admitted, "The first film was a movie,
            and then Jack was put into it almost. He doesn't have the obligations of
            the plot in the same ways that the other characters have.
            He meanders his way through, and he kind of affects everybody else."

            Sparrow represents an ethical pirate, with Captain Barbossa as his corrupt foil,
            though both characters viewed as both light and dark tricksters.
            His true motives usually remain masked, and whether he is honorable
            or evil depends on the audience's perspective.
